## 🪪 Who am I ?

Currently a student at [ESIR](https://esir.univ-rennes.fr/) in Rennes. I have been studying computer science on my own since high school.
I'm intrested in programming language, graphics programming (gpu), OS/system programming.

## ❤️ What do I like ?

I love programming and learning new things.
I also like drumming and more generally music. I especially listen to progressive rock and metal.
Try to listen to [Tesseract](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzvBMFhS0gqjx1rA0bswiHg) 🤘.

## 🔭 Projects that inspires me ...

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

My goals at the moment are :
 - succeed in my studies in computer sciences 🙃
 - create a simple toy language
 - write my own "UI engine" (I don't know how to call that kind of thing)
 - build a simple os from scratch (in the same fashion as the [Essence OS](https://gitlab.com/nakst/essence/))
 - learn rust (yes, maybe one day)

In one word I would like to [reinvent the wheel](https://handmade.network/) so I better understand what it takes to make good quality software without overcomplicate everything.
